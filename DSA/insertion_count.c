/*You are working on an optimization task for a sorting algorithm that uses insertion sort. Your goal is to determine the efficiency of the algorithm by counting the number of swaps needed to sort an array of integers.



Write a program that takes an array as input and calculates the number of swaps performed during the insertion sort process.



Example1

Input:

5

2 1 3 1 2



Output: 

4



Explanation:

Step 1: [2, 1, 3, 1, 2] (No swaps)

Step 2: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] (1 swap, element 1 shifts 1 place to the left)

Step 3: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] (No swaps)

Step 4: [1, 1, 2, 3, 2] (2 swaps; element 1 shifts 2 places to the left)

Step 5: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] (1 swap, element 2 shifts 1 place to the left)

Total number of swaps: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4



Example2

Input:

7

12 15 1 5 6 14 11



Output:

10



Explanation:

Step 1: [12, 15, 1, 5, 6, 14, 11] (No swaps)

Step 2: [12, 15, 1, 5, 6, 14, 11] (1 swap, element 15 shifts 1 place to the left)

Step 3: [12, 15, 1, 5, 6, 14, 11] (No swaps)

Step 4: [1, 12, 15, 5, 6, 14, 11] (2 swaps, element 1 shifts 2 places to the left)

Step 5: [1, 5, 12, 15, 6, 14, 11] (1 swap, element 5 shifts 1 place to the left)

Step 6: [1, 5, 6, 12, 15, 14, 11] (2 swaps, element 6 shifts 2 places to the left)

Step 7: [1, 5, 6, 12, 14, 15, 11] (1 swap, element 14 shifts 1 place to the left)

Step 8: [1, 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15] (3 swaps, element 11 shifts 3 places to the left)

Total number of swaps: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of elements in the array.

The second line of input consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
The output prints the number of swaps performed during the insertion sort process as an integer.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following specifications:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10

1 ≤ array elements ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
2 1 3 1 2
Output 1 :
4
Input 2 :
7
12 15 1 5 6 14 11
Output 2 :
10
