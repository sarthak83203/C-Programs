/*Implement a program using an array-based stack to double(i.e., multiply by 2) the values of a list of integers and display the modified list. The program takes an integer N as input, followed by N integers to be pushed onto the stack. It then doubles the values in the stack and prints the modified list.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of integers to be processed.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the values to be pushed onto the stack.

Output format :
The output prints N space-separated integers, representing the modified values of the stack after doubling each element.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications

Code constraints :
Maximum size of stack = 10

1 ≤ elements pushed into the stack ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4
5 7 8 9
Output 1 :
10 14 16 18 
Input 2 :
7
12 15 26 34 58 64 68
Output 2 :
24 30 52 68 116 128 136
